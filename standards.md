## Course standards

The information below is intended for students in this course. It is your responsibility to read, understand, and follow them.

<br>

### Introduction

As a student in my course, you are responsible for conducting yourself in a manner that supports a positive learning environment for you and your classmates. My expectations are below; please read and follow them.

<br>

### Academic Integrity

Each student is expected to practice *academic integrity*.

Do NOT cheat.

Submit YOUR OWN work. 

Academic dishonesty will NOT be tolerated.

If you are faced with a choice between *cheating* and *losing marks*, the only correct choice is losing marks.

<br>

### Classroom Behaviour

Please arrive on time. If you are late, enter quietly and minimize disruptions.

Please be considerate: Only one person speaks at any one time. Unsolicited comments and side conversations impair the hearing and learning of others. If you insist on commenting or having side conversations during a class, you will be asked to leave.

Disruptive behaviour will not be tolerated. Every student expects the learning environment to support their learning activities. Standards of good behaviour and civility are expected and encouraged.

<br>

### Personal computer and devices

Silcense or turn off devices that emit audible sounds.

**In first-year courses:**

You are *NOT* permitted to use your own device (e.g. laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) in *lecture* sessions, unless notified by the professor in writing.

**In second-, third-, and fourth-year courses:**

You are permitted to use your own device in classes, to support your learning experience. If there is an online test, your professor will announce (before the test date) whether you can use your own personal computer.

Playing computer-based games, or engaging in other computer usage activity that is distracting and disruptive is NOT permitted. You may be asked to leave the class session. In this situation, if you do not comply, I will terminate the class session and leave the room. (Please note that the missed topic coverage will not be delivered, but you and your classmates will still be responsible for mastering the content in a test, lab, or assignment situation.)

<br>

### Taking notes in class

You *must* write your own class notes. You don't have to transcribe verbatim everything that's said in class. Instead, a page or two per period would likely be enough. What notes should you write?
* Topics that you want or need *to learn* or research later
* Topics that you want to *ask questions* about
* Things you want or need to *practice*
* Things that the professor identifies as "*important*"

Do you think that you're too smart to take notes? Or that you'll just remember everything? Or that whatever's being said is boring or unimportant? Or that the content is easily found on a web site?

Well, answer - *truthfully* - this question: What *exactly* did the professor say on October 7 at 1:42pm? 

How can you reduce the amount of notes that you write during a class? Prepare beforehand. If you read the materials for the upcoming class, you will be aware of the topics. Then, during class, you can write good class notes, and spend the rest of the time getting the most out of the classroom experience.

> Do this note-taking task before class, as you prepare, as well as during class. 

As noted above, students in first-year courses cannot use a device in my course's lecture sessions, even to take notes. Instead, use paper and a pencil or pen.
