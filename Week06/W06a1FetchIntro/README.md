###  W06a1FetchIntro

The data comes from a web API request. The request is done with `URLSession` and `URLSessionTask` techniques.

In this app, we send the request from the table view controller.  
In future apps, we will use the data model manager.  

Read the comments in the code.  
And, read and study (and then try to code it yourself) the how-to in the course notes.
