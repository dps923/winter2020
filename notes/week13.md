### Monday plan

*Monday, April 6*

The professor will be available online to provide Assignment 4 assistance to students. 

No new topics today.

<br>

### Thursday plan

*Thursday, April 9* 

On this day, Test 4 will be written. It is worth 14%. It covers (again) Core Data topics from about week 9, and the new topics covered since then. 

Here is more and general information about [the upcoming test](test-success-info). 

Then, in the remaining time, work on the programming assignment, and get help from a classmate or the professor if you need it.
