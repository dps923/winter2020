<br>

#### Test 1

Test 1 is today, at the beginning of the timeslot.

As discussed in class a few times, it will cover past content (from the "outlets" Chapter 4 through to Chapter 8), and new content this week (mostly Chapters 9 and 10). 

Review the relevant info about tests on the [week 3 notes page](week03#practice-test) and on the graded work page.

The test will begin at the start of the class timeslot, at 3:20pm, and its duration will be about 40 minutes. It is worth 12%, which means that you will answer any 12 questions, as each is worth one mark.

After the test, we will have an interactive activity, and there may be time to work on the current assignment.
