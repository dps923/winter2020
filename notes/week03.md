## DPS923 MAP523 Week 3 Notes

The theme for this week is to continue with interaction topics, which keep building upon your recent knowledge and experience. 

<br>

### Thursday plan

Plan for this week:
* Alert and Action Sheet 
* Two-dimensional graphics and touch intro 
* Camera and Photo Library 
* Apple Developer and deploy app to device 

Here is information about [alerts and action sheets](alert-action-sheet). 

Here is information about [two-dimensional graphics and touch](graphics-touch-intro).

Here is information about [photo library and camera](photo-library-camera-intro). 

<br>

### Code examples

The course's GitHub repo has code examples for many topics and techniques. You can download a zip of the code repo, or clone it. 
* Alert and action sheet (modal)
* Shapes (2D graphics and touch)
* Camera and image 
* UIKit Catalog

<br>

### Monday plan

Finish the photo library and camera topic we started on Thursday. 

Then, work on the programming assignment, and get help from a classmate or the professor if you need it.

### Summary

Here's a list of topics that we learned something about this week:
1. Creating UI objects *in code* (instead of using the storyboard and object library)
1. Get the attention of the user with an alert or action sheet 
1. Introduction to a "modal view" and its meaning 
1. Gentle introduction to the Apple Human Interface Guidelines, and how they help and guide us to make good design and coding decisions 
1. Gentle introduction to *closures* in Swift, including their purpose and their generalized syntax 
1. Difference in appearance and interaction between the alert and the action sheet 
1. Similarities in the coding of both (i.e. the sequence of coding steps)
1. Role and purpose of a `UIAlertAction` object, and the role and purpose of a `UIAlertController` object 
1. The iOS SDK has five frameworks for graphics; we will introduce UIKit and Core Graphics topics 
1. The concept of creating a view (`UIView` subclass) programmatically, as a container for graphics content
1. A `UIView` subclass includes initializers and a `draw(_:)` method 
1. The concept of layering, where the display hierarchy is composed of "layers", window, view, subviews 
1. Create bitmap graphics with an in-memory *graphics context* 
1. Coordinate system on iOS starts in upper-left, and is measured in points (not pixels)
1. Rich touch support, known as gestures (tap, swipe, etc.) 
1. `UIGestureRecognizer` base class is used to detect and act upon guestures
1. Using the camera and photo library also requires a programmatically-created controller, `UIImagePickerController` 
1. This controller also requires a delegate to respond to messages (pick/use photo, cancel) 
1. Must have permission from the user; this is configured in `info.plist` settings 
1. On the storyboard, a `UIImageView` UI object is used to display an image or photo
