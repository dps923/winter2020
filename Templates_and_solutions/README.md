## Templates and solutions

### Apple UIKit Catalog

This is the 2018 version of the Apple UIKit Catalog, which is a sample app. It works with our course's Xcode version 10 and iOS SDK version 12. 

> There is a more recent version of the sample app that is posted on Apple's web site, as of early September 2019.  
> However, we cannot conveniently use that sample app, because it assumes Xcode 11+ and iOS SDK 13+.  
> Therefore, we have posted the previous and compatible version here in the templates and solutions folder. 

[Documentation for the sample app is here.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/views_and_controls/uikit_catalog_creating_and_customizing_views_and_controls#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40007710)

### TemplateCDv1 - Core Data project template

Use this project template for an app that will use Core Data technologies.  
Instructions on how to use this as a template is in its [readme](TemplateCDv1/README.md) document.  
Information about its contents is in [this info document](https://dps923.ca/topics/info-project-template-core-data). 

Later versions of the template will add more features (e.g. working with a web API).
