###  W07a1NewFetch

Based on last week's W06a1Fetchintro app.

It is different in these ways:
* It has a data model manager 
* It has a "web API request" factory class
* It relies on the iOS on-device "notification" system 

> Before you run this code example,  
> update the URL string on line 21 of the WebApiRequest class,   
> and the path/segment string on line 28 of the DataModelManager class  

Read the comments in the code.  
And, read and study (and then try to code it yourself) the how-to in the course notes.
