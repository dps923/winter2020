###  W07a2NewMore

Based on last week's W06a2WebApiMore app.

Notice that the POST request sets/updates the `baseUrl` and the `httpMethod` properties.  

> Before you run this code example,  
> update the URL string on line 21 of the WebApiRequest class,   
> and the path/segment string on line 28 of the DataModelManager class  

Read the comments in the code.  
And, read and study (and then try to code it yourself) the how-to in the course notes.
