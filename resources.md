## Learning resources

This page has information about and links to learning resources that you will use in this course.

<br>

### Developer tools

You *must* use a Mac that runs a recent version of macOS. Any kind, laptop, iMac, or Mac mini. The College has lots of Macs, and the School of ICT has a dedicated Mac lab, room A2534. 

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (we will probably use version 9) 

You will need one or more devices. A College or personal desktop or laptop that runs macOS, and (likely) a personal mobile device (e.g. a smartphone).

#### Use macOS

As noted in the [welcome note](welcome), course work is done on a Mac.

If you are not prepared to use a Mac, then *drop the course*.

#### Our Mac mini lab, room A2534

The image below shows the room timetable. As you can see, the room has classes most of the week. However, it appears to be consistently available from 5:10pm onwards, and on the weekend.
