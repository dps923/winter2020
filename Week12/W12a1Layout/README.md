###  W12a1Layout

This is the code example that we built in class  
on Wednesday, November 27, 2019. 

Single-view app project template.  
Then, added, sized, and positioned a number of user interface objects.  

The Week 12 notes document titled  
"User interface layout fundamentals"  
will guide you through this code example. 

Practice on your own!
