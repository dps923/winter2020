###  W09a1LoadV1

Based on the TemplateCDv1 project template. 

This app has a navigation interface.  
The initial scene is managed by a standard view controller.    
It enables the user to create some new objects in the store.  
Also enables navigation to a list of objects, and selection of one of those navigates to a scene with some of the object's contents showing on a standard scene.  

Notice the Loader class:
* It has a reference to the app's data model manager (as you would expect) 
* It enables the creation of new objects 

Study the code in the ExampleList and ExampleScene classes.
