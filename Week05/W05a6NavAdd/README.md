### W05a6NavAdd

Started as a single-view app, but has been modified to meet our needs. Multi-scene, navigation interface, table view, modal detail view, modal "add item" view, etc.

Has a working data model and controller code that can be used in other projects. Assumes a very simple data storage model, persisted as a JSON file in the app's Documents directory. 

Use the project's "Add files to [ProjectName]..." feature. 

Add these source code files for the data model code:
* DataModelClasses.swift 
* DataModelManager.swift

Add the appropriate controller code files:
* ProductListBase.swift
* ProductSceneBase.swift
* ProductDetail.swift
* ProductAdd.swift
* ProductEdit.swift
* ProductAddEdit.swift

The app works correctly, and has more controllers than those on the list above, because they were added and configured to support the app's functionality.
