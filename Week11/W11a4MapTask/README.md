### W11a4MapTask

Based on the W11a3Map (map introduction) app.  

Adds the ability to view a map of the current location.  
The "map view" is on a separate scene, managed by the preferred "task scene" technique.

Another feature is the use of *map annotations*.  
These appear as red pins on the map.  
Two example map annotations are created, nearby the user location.  
Notice that it requires a new class to be defined; it's in the `MapScene.swift` source code file.
